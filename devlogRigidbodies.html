            I started the project by creating point, triangle and rigidbody classes.
            The rigidbody has a mesh made up of an array of traingles, and each triangle has an array of 3 points.(along with a few other things)
            <br /><br />
            When a rigidbody is instntiated it's center of mass is calculated all points in it's mesh are translated so that the center of mass is at (0,0)
            local space and a reference to the rigidbody is added to the renderer's list of objects to render.
            <br /><br />
            I also wrote a simple function to take txt files and convert them into meshes with this format:
            <div style="
    background-color: dimgrey;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    padding: 10px;
    width:150px;
    border-style:solid;
    "><pre>(0,0):(1,0):(1,1)
(0,0):(0,1):(1,1)</pre></div>

            <br /><i>Shown above is the coordinates for a 1x1 square where each line is a different triangle in the mesh</i>
        </p>
    </div>
