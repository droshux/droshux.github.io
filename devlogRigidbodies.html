            I started the project by creating point, triangle and rigidbody classes.
            The rigidbody has a mesh made up of an array of traingles, and each triangle has an array of 3 points.(along with a few other things)
            <br /><br />
            When a rigidbody is instntiated it's center of mass is calculated all points in it's mesh are translated so that the center of mass is at (0,0)
            local space and a reference to the rigidbody is added to the renderer's list of objects to render.
            <br /><br />
            I also wrote a simple function to take txt files and convert them into meshes with this format:
            <div style="
    background-color: dimgrey;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    padding: 10px;
    width:150px;
    border-style:solid;
    "><pre>(0,0):(1,0):(1,1)
(0,0):(0,1):(1,1)</pre></div>

            <br /><i>Shown above is the coordinates for a 1x1 square where each line is a different triangle in the mesh</i>
            <br /><br />After that I wrote the rendering engine to draw these arbitrary 2D meshes to the screen.

            I used my (limited) knowledge of linear algebra to write a function to rotate the meshes.
            However I had the issue where the object was shrunk to a microscopic size and squewed.
            Luckily with a second pair of eyes (thanks Jacob) I was able to locate my stupid typo

            The other issue I was having was that the program would only render 1 or 2 frames.
            And would render them only after the rest of the program was finished. So I reached out
            to <i>xirado</i> and <i>Archduke Liamus</i> on the <i>Java Discord API</i> discord server
            and they gave me the advice to look into creating a buffer with a system built into the 
            system I was using to create the simulation window (AWT). When I looked into it I found
            <a href="https://gist.github.com/iiAtlas/4122531" class="githubLink" style="font-size: medium;"><i>iiAtlas</i>'s code to buffer frames</a>
            That I then proceeded to steal and adapt to my own use. Now the software can animate movement<br />
            and rotation.

            Today I used the builder design pattern to create a builder for RigidBody instances.
            This was because one of my goals is to make it as easy as possible for others to set up physics simulations.
            By using the Builder design pattern you can now create Rigidbodies by chaining methods to set various properties.
            This was inspired by minecraft mod KubeJS's system for registering new blocks and items to the game. <br /><br />
            <i>KubeJS inspiration:</i><br />
            <img src="images/rb/day4/kubejsExample.png" width="350"/>
            <br /><br />
            <i>My method:</i><br />
            <img src="images/rb/day4/myExample.png" width="350"/>
            <br /><br />
            Then I wrote the code that handles basic forces. Each rigidbody has a List of force vectors. Every frame the object
            is accelerated depending on the forces and then moved. Velocity is carried through betweem frames. 
            <br /><br />
            With that I added a simple gravity system and quickly discovered that the screen was being rendered upside down.
            This was because (0,0) in AWT's coordinate system is <b>top</b> left and I was using <b>bottom</b> left.
            Luckily when I figured it out it was an easy fix. 
            <br /><br />
            My next goal is to add collision and then after that <i>moments...</i>

        After consulting my Physics teacher <i>Dr Reid</i>, we came up with a system for collision detection. Each point in
        the 2D mesh would create a circle around and check if it would intersect any lines from other rigidbodies. The radius
        of this circle would be: <b>Speed x Delta</b> <i>(where delta is the time(s) that the frame should take</i>. So the 
        circle represents all locations the point could move to this frame. Luckily for me AS-Level Maths teaches you a 
        method to find if a circle intersects a line:
        <ul>
            <li>Take the equation of the circle <i>(x-p)&sup2;+(y-q)&sup2;=r&sup2;</i> and substitute in the equation of
            the line <i>y=mx+c</i></li>
            <li>Rearange to form a quadratic equation (equal to 0) in terms of x</li>
            <li>And find the discriminant: &Delta;=b&sup2;-4ac</li>
            <li>If the discriminant is 0 or more the line and the circle intersect.</li>
        </ul>
        Then I used a whiteboard and a lot of algebra to find the generic formula for &Delta; so I could write the code for
        collision:
        <img src="images/rb/day5-maths.jpg" width="400px" /><br />
        Then I mocked it up in Desmos to test that my maths worked:
        <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pf5h76tv1o" class="githubLink">[Interactive Desmos Link]</a><br />
        Unfortunately I got loads of errors and after re-doing my maths multiple times (and fixing some of the errors) when
        the maths was perfect I was still having issues. This was because I completely forgot to convert some points from local
        to world place. I felt like a right idiot...

        Implementing collision required re-writing some of my code to use points with Velocity. But then after two tries I managed 
        to get the points to bounce correctly (independant of eachother...) thanks to <a class="githubLink" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/573084/how-to-calculate-bounce-angle?noredirect=1&lq=1">This</a>
        on <b>stackoverflow</b>. The points were bouncing perfectly...<br><br>
        Until they didn't. After an <i><b>inconsistent</b></i> number of bounces the points would start to move to the left skewing the shape.

        <i><ol>
            <li>Ignore the discord notifications I didn't notice they were there until it was too late</li>
            <li>Also ignore the vertical distortion that comes from the points moving through eachother. This is <b>enirely intentional.</b></li>
        </ol></i>
        After two hours of searching I foundthat the points were moving so fast that their detection radius was big enough to also encompass
        the internal lines in the rectangular mesh I was using for the floor.<br><img src="images/rb/day6-tsquare.png" width="50px" height="50px"/>
        <br>
        As a bid to fix this I made sure that only the point of intersection with the collision detection cirlce that is closest to the center would be used
        and only one per rigidbody. But...
        <br><br>
        <b><i><u>NOTHING HAPPENED!</u></i></b>
        I'm so stuck...

        <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>26th of June 2022</b></p>
        So... it's been a month... and I have been struggling with getting objects to collide correctly. After the "points with individual velocities" 
        method didn't work out I tried using a strange frankentein's monster of <i>line-marching</i> and <i>binary search</i> to snap objects to the surface
        they are colliding with and then apply a <b>Normal Reaction Force</b> however this came with it's own issues. However when trying to fix these
        I discovered that: <b><i>My entire colision detection algorithm is broken.</i></b>
        <br />
        <br />
        It fails to account for:
        <ul>
            <li>Other objects moving</li>
            <li>Rotation of any kind</li>
        </ul>
        Next I will try <i>stepping throught the time between frames</i> on a canvas level and <i>find the first point where collisions occur</i>. Then I will re-use 
        some of my old <i>normal reaction</i> code to apply reaction forces that <b>should</b> allow objects to collide accurately.
