            I started the project by creating point, triangle and rigidbody classes.
            The rigidbody has a mesh made up of an array of traingles, and each triangle has an array of 3 points.(along with a few other things)
            <br /><br />
            When a rigidbody is instntiated it's center of mass is calculated all points in it's mesh are translated so that the center of mass is at (0,0)
            local space and a reference to the rigidbody is added to the renderer's list of objects to render.
            <br /><br />
            I also wrote a simple function to take txt files and convert them into meshes with this format:
            <div style="
    background-color: dimgrey;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    padding: 10px;
    width:150px;
    border-style:solid;
    "><pre>(0,0):(1,0):(1,1)
(0,0):(0,1):(1,1)</pre></div>

            <br /><i>Shown above is the coordinates for a 1x1 square where each line is a different triangle in the mesh</i>
            <br /><br />After that I wrote the rendering engine to draw these arbitrary 2D meshes to the screen.

            I used my (limited) knowledge of linear algebra to write a function to rotate the meshes.
            However I had the issue where the object was shrunk to a microscopic size and squewed.
            Luckily with a second pair of eyes (thanks Jacob) I was able to locate my stupid typo

            The other issue I was having was that the program would only render 1 or 2 frames.
            And would render them only after the rest of the program was finished. So I reached out
            to <i>xirado</i> and <i>Archduke Liamus</i> on the <i>Java Discord API</i> discord server
            and they gave me the advice to look into creating a buffer with a system built into the 
            system I was using to create the simulation window (AWT). When I looked into it I found
            <a href="https://gist.github.com/iiAtlas/4122531" class="githubLink" style="font-size: medium;"><i>iiAtlas</i>'s code to buffer frames</a>
            That I then proceeded to steal and adapt to my own use. Now the software can animate movement<br />
            and rotation.
