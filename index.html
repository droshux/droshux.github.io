        <h3>Personal Introduction:</h3>
        <p>
            Hi I'm <b>Hux</b>, I'm a British A-level computer science student who can program with some degree of skill.
            As you can tell web development is not my strong suit but I am an experienced <i>Googler</i> so theoretically I can solve pretty much any problem with enough time <i>(and cursewords)</i>.
            <br><br>My favourite language is <b>Java</b> because it's strong typing and strict syntax give me enough structure to keep my code neat (but still allowing elegant code and fancy shenanigans).
            Its heavy emphasis on <b>OOP</b> allows me to focus on the re-usability and expandability of my code. This allows me to write with a mindset focused on building "tools" for imaginary future developers
            and myself. <br><br> The real reason I love Java is because I actually like <b>C#</b> however when I switched to <i>Arch Linux</i> it just wouldn't do to be so tied to Microsoft and dotnet.
            <br><i>Hey did I tell you I use arch linux? Hey where are you going?... Hey!</i>

                <p>This was my attempt at making the background colour of this webpage <span style="color: #C6FFFB;">(#C6FFFB)</span> with a low roughness value but since there are no blocks in minecraft close to that value it is not very accurate</p>

        <p>
            I have recently started working on a Rigidbody physics simulator in Java for my <b>Computer Science A-Level course</b>. I am in early stages of development but so far I have created the 2D mesh
            rendering system (with rotation) and working on the frame/animation system (which is itself causing rendering issues). I am using my knowledge of maths and physics to try and build the engine from
            the ground up.
